# PyRC
PyRC - A python IRC client built in python and can be modded with python.
It is still in development, quite early stages of it too, so not everything works and not everything is there.
If you do use it, expect only base functionality, I am a solo dev and I work on it as much as I can.

## Requirements

- Python3
- GTK3 ( sudo apt-get install python3-gi )
